A small learning project i decided to take on during my summer break in order to better familiarize my self with both OpenGL and Phong Lighting, this involved me learning about a vairety fo topics such 
as coordinate spaces, OpenGl's rendering pipline, and matrix mathematics behind projecting 3D objects into a 2D space. Though this maybe a small project, it has taught me a lot more about lower level development.

Topics: 
lighting shaders 
model,view, projection Matrices 
Lighting calculations using vector mathematics 
specular,emission,diffuse lighting maps
